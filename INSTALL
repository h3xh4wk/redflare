DEVELOPMENT:

Redflare is built on Cement, but is currently built against the development
version.  Therefore, you will also need to Git clone and install Cement
and the 'clibasic' plugin from cement-plugins on github:

    * git://github.com/derks/cement.git
    * git://github.com/derks/cement-plugins.git
    
Then:    
    
$ virtualenv ~/devel/env/redflare --no-site-packages

$ source ~/devel/env/redflare/bin/activate

$ git clone git://github.com/derks/redflare.git

$ cd redflare

$ python setup.py develop


PRODUCTION:

Redflare is currently in development/beta, and does not have a proper path
for production usage.  That said, a source install of the git checkout
will work.

$ sudo python setup.py install
