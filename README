NAME: redflare

CREATOR: BJ Dierkes <wdierkes@5dollarwhitebox.org>

DESCRIPTION:

Redflare is a Command Line Interface for the RHN Satellite Server.  Its 
goal is to provide easy access to certain operations that make working with
RHNSS easier.  

Currently this is a young project, and features are limited.  The initial and
primary goal of the project was to enable the ability to mirror RHN Channels
to local Yum repositories.
 
DISCLAIMER:

It should be *strictly* noted that mirroring RHN channels into Yum repos is 
for internal and restricted uses only.  At no time should said repos be made
publicly available to any systems that do not have the appropriate 
entitlements to those channels.  The authors and contributors of the Redflare 
project are not responsible for misuse of the mirroring features.  In order to 
mirror channels to Yum repos, you must have the credentials to log into the 
Satellite server making the user of this software fully liable for any 
distribution or copyright infringements of Red Hat software.
